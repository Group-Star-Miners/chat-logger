# Chat Logger
This plugin logs all the clan chat messages to a file.
The log file rotation happens on a daily basis and up to 7 log files are kept.

The logs can be found at RuneLite's home folder under the `clanchatlogs` directory. To find runelite's home navigate to `%userprofile%\.runelite` on Windows or `$HOME/.runelite` on Linux and macOS.
